# Structural Hallucination Model (SHM)

The **Structural Hallucination Model (SHM)** formalizes how a *Structural Induction Pattern (SIP)* can both suppress and amplify hallucinations in reasoning or language models.

---

## 📘 Concept

Language models optimize **coherence**, not truth.
When SIP applies **structured pressure** (topic anchoring + controlled repetition + limited alternatives), it channels that coherence toward a fixed path.
If the path is correct → hallucinations drop.
If the path is wrong → the model builds a *logically consistent illusion*.

## ⚙️ Core Variables

| Symbol | Meaning                                               |
| :----- | :---------------------------------------------------- |
| **A**  | Anchor strength (topic fixation 0–1)                  |
| **P**  | Structural pressure (0–1)                             |
| **R**  | Repetition depth (pattern iterations)                 |
| **B**  | Bridge rate (topic return frequency 0–1)              |
| **E**  | Evidence alignment (factual consistency 0–1)          |
| **Δ**  | Premise distortion (anchor error magnitude)           |
| **C**  | Output coherence (linguistic / logical stability 0–1) |
| **H**  | Hallucination likelihood (0–1)                        |

## 🧮 Model Relations

```text
C ≈ 1 - exp[-(α1A + α2P + α3R + α4B)]
H ≈ σ( β1·C·Δ  −  β2·E  +  β3·P )
```

* High **C** improves stability but can **lock-in errors** when Δ > 0 or E < 0.5.
* Structural pressure **P** reduces noise yet risks structured hallucination.

## ✅ Safe Operating Zones

| Zone        | Condition                      | Action                       |
| ----------- | ------------------------------ | ---------------------------- |
| **Stable**  | E ≥ 0.7  and  Δ ≤ 0.1          | Strengthen SIP (A,P,R,B ↑)   |
| **Caution** | 0.4 ≤ E < 0.7 or 0.1 < Δ ≤ 0.3 | Limit P; validate anchors    |
| **Risk**    | E < 0.4 or Δ > 0.3             | Reduce P & R; replace anchor |

## 🔬 Experiment Protocol

1. **Setup:** multiple LLMs × domains × languages
2. **Anchors:** True / Mixed / False premises
3. **Metrics:**

   * C (coherence) via NLI and discourse scoring
   * E (factual alignment) via fact-checker + human labels
   * H (hallucination rate) = error density × coherence weight
4. **Analysis:** ANOVA on (A,P,R,B,E,Δ) effects

---

## ⚠️ Risks

* Over-structuring ⇒ loss of creative divergence
* Wrong anchor ⇒ high-fidelity falsehood
* Mis-measured E ⇒ feedback loop bias

---

## 🧠 Takeaway

> **SIP doesn’t remove hallucination; it shapes it.**
> Correct anchors produce alignment.
> Wrong anchors produce *coherent hallucination* — truth-looking error.
